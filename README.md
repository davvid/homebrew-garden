# Homebrew Formula for Garden

Homebrew formula for [Garden](https://github.com/davvid/garden), the Git
multi-repo powertool.

Run these steps to install `garden` using Homebrew on macOS:

    brew tap davvid/homebrew-garden
    brew install garden

The formula in this repository will be contributed to homebrew-core and retired
[once Garden gets enough forks, watchers or stars](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/119195).
